# Introduction

- ## Node.js is a Runtime Environment. Not a Programming language or a Framework like ASP.NET or Rails.
- ## Used to create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) - Backend Services
- ## Can be used in Prototyping or Agile development approaches.
- ## Highly scalable; Can be used to build IO intensive and realtime applications (Not CPU intensive applications)
- ## By dafault Node uses `Asynchronous Architecture`.
    > ### i.e Multiple client requests will be handled by a single thread.  
    > ### `Synchronous/ Blocking Architecture` means one request will be blocked while the thread is serving the other request (Ex: ASP.NET & Rails).

# Introduction

- ## Node.js is a Runtime Environment. Not a Programming language or a Framework like ASP.NET or Rails.
- ## Used to create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) - Backend Services
- ## Can be used in Prototyping or Agile development approaches.
- ## Highly scalable; Can be used to build IO intensive and realtime applications (Not CPU intensive applications)
- ## By dafault Node uses `Asynchronous Architecture`.
    > ### i.e When working with a certain operation, the thread won't wait (block) for the result and it will be released to serve other requests.  
    > ### `Synchronous/ Blocking Architecture` means one request will be blocked while the thread is serving the other request (Ex: ASP.NET & Rails).
- ## In Node, browser environment objects like window and document are not available.

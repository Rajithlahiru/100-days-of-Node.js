# 1. Lexical Grammar

* JavaScript Syntax kind of thing.
* For the interpreter to understand the JavaScript, the string needs to be parsed to a structured repersentation which called as the Lexical Analysis. 
* Then white spaces, line terminations and comments will be stripped.
* Other than single line and block comments, there's another one called `Hashbang comments` which is used to set the env path in unix systems. (This hashbang comment is only valid at the absolute start of the script module).

```javascript
	#!/usr/bin/env node

	console.log("Hello World");
```
* Strict mode makes it easier to write secure JS; makes the syntax errors to throw errors.
* Decimal literals start with 0 followed by another decimal digit and if it's smaller than 8 it will be treated as a octal.

```javascript
	0888 //parsed as decimal
	0777 ///parsed as octal
```

* Binary numbers --> 0b or 0B 

```javascript
	0b10000000000000000000000000000000 // 2147483648
	0b01111111100000000000000000000000 // 2139095040 
```

* Octals --> 0o or 0O

```javascript
	0O755 // 493
	0o644 // 420
```

* Hexadecimal --> 0x or 0X

```javascript
	0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF // 295147905179352830000
	0XA                 // 10
```

* As a habit, always insert the semicolon ;;;


# 2. Expressions

* Primary expressions
* Left-hand-side expressions...etc

# 3. Data Types

* JS is a dynamically typed language.
> typeof(null) --> object  
> typeof(undefined) --> undefined  
> typeof(boolean) --> boolean  
> typeof(number) --> number  
> typeof(bigint) --> bigint  
> typeof(string) --> string  
> typeof(symbol) --> symbol  

# 4. Classes

```javascript
	class Rectangle{
		constructor(height, width){
			this.height = height;
			this.width = width;
		}	
	}
```

```javascript
	const Rectangle = class {
  		constructor(height, width) {
    			this.#height = height; //Height is a private field
   	 		this.width = width;
  		}
	};
```

# 5. Varibles

* Variables are variables. (let, var, const)

# 6. Functions

# 7. This Operator

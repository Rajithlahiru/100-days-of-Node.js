# Introduction

* Aggregation: Collection and summary of data
* Stage: One of the built-in methods that can be completed on the data, but does not permanently alter it.
* Aggregation pipeline: A series of stages completed on the data in order.

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
    {
        $stage1: {
            { expression1 },
            { expression2 }
        },
        $stage2: {
            { expression1 }
        }
    }
])
```

* Usage of `$match` and `$gorup`

```javascript
    {
        $match: {
            "field_name": "value"
        }
    }
```

```javascript
    {
        $group:
            {
                _id: <expression>, // Group key
                <field>: { <accumulator> : <expression> }
            }
    }
 ```

Example:  
```javascript
    db.sightings.aggregate([
    {$match: {species_common: "Eastern Bluebird"}}, 
    {$group: {
        _id: '$location.coordinates', 
        number_of_sightings: {$count: {}}
        }}
    ])
```

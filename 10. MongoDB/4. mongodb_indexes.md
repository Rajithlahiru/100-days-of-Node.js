- [Indexes MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/#:~:text=MongoDB%20uses%20multikey%20indexes%20to,or%20elements%20of%20the%20arrays.)
- Indexes are a special data structure that stores a potion of a collection's data in order to increase the query performance and disk I/O.
- If there's no index, mongoDB needs to scan through all the relevent documents to find a specific result.

### Working with single field indexes

- To create a single field index:

```javascript
db.customers.createIndex({ birthdate: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

- To view the indexes in a collection

```javascript
db.collection.getIndexes();
```

- Using the `explain()`: The explain command provides information on the execution of the following commands: aggregate , count , distinct , find , findAndModify , delete , mapReduce , and update .

```javascript
db.accounts.explain().find(/* your query here */);
```

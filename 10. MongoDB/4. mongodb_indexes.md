- [Indexes MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/#:~:text=MongoDB%20uses%20multikey%20indexes%20to,or%20elements%20of%20the%20arrays.)
- Indexes are a special data structure that stores a potion of a collection's data in order to increase the query performance and disk I/O.
- If there's no index, mongoDB needs to scan through all the relevent documents to find a specific result.

### Working with single field indexes

- To create a single field index:

```javascript
db.customers.createIndex({ birthdate: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

- To view the indexes in a collection

```javascript
db.collection.getIndexes();
```

- Using the `explain()`: The explain command provides information on the execution of the following commands: aggregate , count , distinct , find , findAndModify , delete , mapReduce , and update .

```javascript
db.accounts.explain().find(/* your query here */);
```

### Compound Indexes

```javascript
db.customers.createIndex({
  active: 1,
  birthdate: -1,
  name: 1,
});
```

- The order of the fields matters when creating the index and the sort order. It is recommended to list the fields in the following order: Equality, Sort, and Range.
  - Equality: field/s that matches on a single field value in a query
  - Sort: field/s that orders the results by in a query
  - Range: field/s that the query filter in a range of valid values

### Deleting mongodb indexes

- To view the indexes `db.collection.getIndexes()`. Then select the relevent index that you need to delete or hide.

```javascript
db.customers.dropIndex("active_1_birthdate_-1_name_1");
```

- To drop multiple indexes.

```javascript
db.collection.dropIndexes(["index1name", "index2name", "index3name"]);
```

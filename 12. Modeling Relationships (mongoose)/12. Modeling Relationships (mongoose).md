# Relationships between Objects/ Documents

## Using References (Normalization)

- In order to decide what method to used whe creatinf relationships between objects, a tradeoff between `query performance` vs `consistency` must be performed.

- Provides `data consistency`
- Ex: 
```javascript
    let author = { name: 'myName' };
    let course = { author: 'newAuthor' };
```

## Using Embedded Documents (References)

- Provides `performance`
- Ex: 
```javascript
    let course = { author: { name: 'myName' } };
```

## Hybrid Approach

```javascript
    let author = { name: 'myName' };
    let course = { author: { name: 'myName' } };
```

## Referencing a Document

- When referencing to a certain document, the type of the reference item must be `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`.

Ex: Referencing the Course document `author` attribute to the name in `Author` document.

```javascript
const Course = mongoose.model('courses', new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    author: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.types.ObjectId, 
        ref: 'Authors'
    }
}));
```

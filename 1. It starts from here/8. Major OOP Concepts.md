# Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript

- Introduced in ES6.
- Fact: [Array] is an Object while "string" is a String.
- Constructor which is placed inside the Class will be executed first when the class called (I guess)

```javascript
class Person{
    constructor (Student_name, Student_age){
        this.name = Student_name;
        this.age = Student_age;
    }
}
```
> Reason for using "THIS" inside the constructor is, When instantiating the object with parameters, those cannot be accessed inside the class. "THIS" keyword states that the variable which is referenced has the value which is passed through the arguments when instantiating the class.

- We can pass array of objects to another object.
```javascript
let student_1 = new Student("Morgan", 23);
let student_2 = new Student("David", 22);
let student_3 = new Student("David", 24);

let classroom_1 = new Classroom("Science Class", 50, [student_1, student_2, student_3]);
```
## ABSTRACTION

> It's like hiding the implementation of a certain code block.  

Ex: Using the methods inside the dom class.

## ENCAPSULATION

> Protects the build in classes from outside users.  

Ex:  
```javascript
    constructor(a, b){
        this._name = a;
        this._age = b;
    }
```

## INHERITANCE

> Process of the inheritation of some properties from a parent class.

Ex:  
```javascript
class Student{ //PARENT CLASS
    constructor (name, age){
        this.student_name = name;
        this.student_age = age;
    }
    getStudentDetails = () => { console.log(`Name is ${this.student_name} and the age is  ${student_age}`); }
}

class Intern extends Student{ //CHILD CLASS
    constructor (name, age, salary, skill){ //Parent class arguments must be included in super() function
        super(name, age);
        this.intern_salary = salary;
        this.intern_skill = skill;
    }
    getInternDetails = () => { console.log(`Name: ${this.name}`) }
}

let intern1 = new Intern("John", 23, 100000, "MERN");
intern1.getStudentDetails(); // We can access the parent class through the child class
intern1.getInternDetails();
```

## POLYMOPHISM

> It's the process of one thing taking many forms.  
Ex: Method Overloading, Mehtod Overriding
